In general [restautants](https://restaurantappnow.io/), it's best practice to wait until all guests at a table have finished before clearing a course's dishes, especially if you work in a relatively formal dining setting. Clearing one guest's dish before the others may make his or her companions feel rushed and uncomfortable.
